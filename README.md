# mutl
Micro Userland Thread Library (aka mutl) is a toy project aiming to develop a simple portable thread library running in userland of an UNIX-like system.

Originally developed on Solaris 8 (SPARC), it works also on more modern Solarises (tested on Solaris 10 and current 11.4 SRU60), macOS 10.10+, NetBSD 9.3 and likely many others.

The repository contains the Dining philosophers problem program implemented using the mutl.
